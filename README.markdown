# Welcome to OCILL

OCILL (Online Components for Intensive Language Learning) is a tool for creating, displaying and grading language learning quizzes.  

Instructors can create two types of quizzes (Fill in the Blank, Grid) and include the quizzes in learning management systems that implement the [LTI](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability) protocol.  Ocill displays the quiz inside the LMS and passes a grade to the LMS.
